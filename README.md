# Weather Forecast API
***What is it?*** It's an ASP.NET Core web API with some layers of cache/persistence using the ResponseCaching service for the endpoint and SQLite for persistence.  

***How does it work?*** Open the appsettings.json file, set the API key,and you are good to go.You will be prompted with various choices in the terminal. (Suggestion: first verify the API key).The values are fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API. 

***Where do I get the API key?*** This API is based on [OpenWeathermapSITE](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys), get it from there. Currently, I am using the Free plan.
